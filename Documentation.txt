Audio Visualizer Documentation

Additional Features:
AUDIO
-None of the original tracks are present, instead I have put
5 tracks of my choice.
-The user can choose a file of their own to play. This makes
the selection the current track being played, but also pauses
all audio, so the "Play" button must be clicked to start the
selected track. This track is not saved anywhere.
-Delay/Reverb slider. It is somewhat finnicky, despite the
fact that I had used an identical node setup before and it
worked flawlessly. Delay and Volume both affect the visualization.
-Both frequency and waveform data can be visualized, controled
by a set of radio checkboxes.

VISUAL
-Although I kept the circles from earlier, the max radius of these
circles can be adjusted. This also adjusts the bars that are
drawn.
- Horizontal and vertical visualization lines can be selected,
with inverted reflections shown when another box is checked.
-Checkboxes also control the circles and bars.
-The background has the plain black default, along with both
Linear and Radial gradient options, controlled by a radio
checkbox trio.
-There is a simple blue and black default for both gradients.
-If the user has either gradient type selected, they can
customize the gradient displayed using the 4 different color
selectors. They can then choose how many Color Stops they want
in their new gradient, between 2-4. Clicking the "Create New
Gradient" button when any gradient type is selected will create
a respective gradient with the selected color stops, evenly
divided, and immediately apply it to the background.
-The color of any other main part of the visualizer, except for
the circles, can be selected as well. Color changes for
horizontal and vertical lines, as well as the bars, are
immediately applied.
-The user can also check off to apply simple, additional effects:
Noise, Inverted Colors, and and Emboss effect.
